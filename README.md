"Sudo Mode" is a Drupal module which takes inspiration from the unix
[sudo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo) program which allows you to escalate
yourself to a priviledged user in order to perform an action. While this module
doesn't swap your user role, it will ensure sensitive areas of your site request
that you supply your password before being able to complete an action.

### Usage

To get started, download and install the module. Once installed, navigate to
`admin/config/people/sudo_mode`.
